# https://www.mankier.com/1/surfraw#Configuration
#
# Surfraw gets its configuration from three sources, in order:
# 1. Environment variables
# 2. /etc/xdg/surfraw/conf
# 3. $HOME/.config/surfraw/conf

# List surfraw angines
sr -elvi

# Find where search engines are located on a debian system
# in order to create your own. The following command will propably
# return '/usr/lib/surfraw/github' on  a debian system:
dpkg -L surfraw | grep youtube

# Create your custom search inside an 'elvi' directory
mkdir ~/.config/surfraw/elvi
# and copy the template inside it.
cp /usr/lib/surfraw/youtube ./template
# Then make it executable
chmode +x template
# Run 'sr -elvi' once again to verify LOCAL ELVI at the end of the list
sr -elvi

# alias sr for a 'cli' browser and 'surfraw' for a gui one.
alias sr='sr -browser=$BROWSERCLI'
alias srf='surfraw -browser=$BROWSER'
